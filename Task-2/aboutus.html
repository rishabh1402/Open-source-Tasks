        <h1>Who We Are </h1>
        <p>Nature Safe is a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to bring change in our society and 
           create a just future. Our goal is to use the power of Will of People to illuminate the way toward a better world, inspire
           other people to walk that path with us, and show that the time for action is now.
           All over the Country, we are standing up for our communities, and we are holding governments and corporations accountable. Our Planet - 
           a  pale blue dot on the vast canvas of the universe, is fast approaching a point of no return. In the current world order, 
           materialism supersedes human values, economy is more treasured than ecology and profits are prioritized over people. This 
           ceaseless demand for more is pushing our soil, air, water, food, forests and climate closer to an inevitable collapse. </p>
        
        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <p>We believe optimism is a form of courage. We believe that a billion acts of courage can spark a brighter tomorrow. To that end
           we model courage, we champion courage, we share stories of courageous acts by our supporters and allies, we invite people out of 
           their comfort zones to take courageous action with us, individually in their daily lives, and in community with others who share 
           our commitment to a better world. A green and peaceful future is our quest.</p>

        <h1>Our Promise</h1>
        <p>We strive to cut through the noise, providing trustworthy content that’s both authoritative and accessible.
            <p>Never preach. Just because we are experts doesn’t mean we are self-righteous. We may be peachy, but never preachy.</p>
            <p>Trust science. We’ll never be swayed by the latest hot takes or political spin. The foundation of our writing, editing, and 
                    fact-checking processes is rigorous scientific research—and we always cite our sources.</p>
                <p>Welcome everyone. Saving the planet isn’t a special club. At Nature Safe, there are no secret codewords or handshakes. 
                    This is a place where everyone should feel comfortable; where everyone can ask, learn, share, and be a part of a global
                    globe-loving community.</p>
